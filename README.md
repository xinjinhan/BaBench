## OVERVIEW ##

BigBench is a big data benchmark suite that helps evaluate different big data framework (such as [Spark SQL](https://github.com/apache/spark), [Hive](https://github.com/apache/hive), [Impala](https://github.com/apache/impala), and etc). By now, BigBench contains TPC-DS and TPC-H, two commonly used decision support system benchmarks. BigBench can be easily used to benchmark Spark. BigBench will support more benchmarks in the future. BigBench will also support cloud-native systems and service monitoring system (such as [prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus/prometheus)) later.
